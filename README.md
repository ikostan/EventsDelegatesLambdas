## Description:
Events, delegates and lambdas play an important role in the .NET framework but can be difficult to understand as developers first 
get started with the C# language. If you’re interested in gaining a more thorough understanding of how these C# technologies work 
then you’re in the right place! This course focuses solely on events, delegates and lambdas and provides insight into how they can 
be used in your .NET applications using the C# language.
